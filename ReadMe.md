## Notes
- Please be patient when starting the first `waydroid` app through `xwaydroid`.
    A black `kwin_wayland` window for a few minutes, before you see the LineageOS loading logo, is normal.
- If switching between `waydroid` apps through `xwaydroid`, it's recommended to leave the `kwin_wayland` window open.
    Closing / re-opening the `kwin_wayland` window leads to a "reboot" of the `waydroid` session which takes a while.
    Leaving the `kwin_wayland` window, leads to instant startup of new `waydroid` apps.
- Opening / using multiple `waydroid` apps through `xwaydroid` is supported, albeit through a single `kwin_wayland` window. 
- The default values of some optional-options,
    can be configured in the `Default Settings` section at the start of the `xwaydroid` script.
